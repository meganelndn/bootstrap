# Designing without CSS
(at least designing without WRITING CSS)

You just pitched an idea to your boss, and his answer was:

“Great show me a prototype tomorrow”, hmm.


Time to get the most done in the shortest amount of time.

# Your task

Create a prototype for any site (suggestions below) without writing a line of CSS. But using a framework instead.


You can go with any framework you have not used before, and a few suggestions are:

        Bulma.io
        Getbootstrap.com
        Purecss.io
        Muicss.com
        tailwindcss.com (quite different but quite popular)

The main idea behind all of them, is that you link to their CSS (and sometimes JS) and then you blindly copy paste their code examples and adjust as needed.


# What to build

If you have an idea, go for it, otherwise, here’s a few suggestions on what you could make a prototype for

        You portfolio
        Redesign your Kanban app
        A blog
        A newspaper


# Requirements

        State clearly in the footer which framework you used
        Have at least two pages
        No CSS written
